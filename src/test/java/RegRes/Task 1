Task 1: What would you say were the causes of a code quality or deployment rollback you have
experienced in production? (Your answer should not be more than 70 words).

Answer;
I can give an example for code quality or rollback deployment experience.
In a project we used SOLID principles to write code quality and clean code.
We can express it as S - Single-responsiblity Principle, O - Open-closed Principle,
L - Liskov Substitution Principle, I - Interface Segregation Principle and
D - Dependency Inversion Principle. I guess I don't need to explain separately.
In addition, the understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
can be expressed as principles that determine code quality.
For Rollyback, I used Git stash. Because, It's important to note that rolling back
the deployment will not revert the files in your repository.
The next time you deploy, all the changes that
you rolled back will be again uploaded to your remote server.
So it is important that you revert or fix the offending changes in your repository as well.
